Query/Search params are used to represent a change in the UI.
For eg: filtering, pagination, sorting etc.
We can't share the current state as state resets on page reload.
so for eg: if we want to share the results of 4 filters applied etc
then the best approach would be to put the filters in the URL only.

Query params are key/value pairs -> /vans?type=rugged
